# Predicting Customer Churn for a Bank

**Research Topic:**
Customer retention is vital for any business, and the banking sector is no exception. With the rise of
digital banking and increased competition, understanding why customers leave and predicting
potential churn is crucial. Our team aims to delve deep into the factors influencing customer churn
for a bank. By using machine learning and data analytics techniques, we want to predict the
likelihood of a customer leaving the bank in the upcoming months. This prediction, backed by
insights from the data, can help the bank in formulating effective retention strategies.

**Objective:**
Our primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at the
highest risk of churning in the next three months. Additionally, we aim to analyze and interpret the
data to discover the main drivers of customer churn. These insights will provide the bank with
actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**SMART Question:**
1. Is the interaction between Months_on_book and Total_Relationship_Count relevant to
the bank's strategic objectives, particularly in the context of diminishing customer
attrition?
2. Is there a measurable trend that shows how Months_on_book affects customer
attrition over time, perhaps by analyzing attrition rates in different periods?
3. Is there a discernible pattern where clients in higher income categories exhibit a lower
attrition rate, and if so, what strategies can be formulated to enhance client retention
among those in lower-income categories?
4. Can we predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank based on their past transaction behaviour and demographic information?

**Modeling Methods:**
We propose to start with a baseline model using Logistic Regression to establish initial performance
metrics. Subsequent models will include more complex algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient
Boosted Trees. We will also consider neural networks if the dataset size and feature engineering
justify its use. Model evaluation will be done using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
and the AUC-ROC curve. Feature importance and model interpretability will also be integral parts of
our analysis.
